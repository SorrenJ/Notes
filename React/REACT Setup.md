Let's set up our new project!

In your terminal, type the following command to invoke the Node Package eXecutor (npx) with our package.

```terminal
  $ npx create-react-app tourney-matches
```


``` terminal

Success! Created tourney-matches at /home/labber/lighthouse/react/tourney-matches/tourney-matches
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd tourney-matches
  npm start

Happy hacking!
```
